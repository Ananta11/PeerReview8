# Peer Review 8
#### A simple project for persistent storage in iOS.
##### This project is 8/15 Peer Review projects done in the course \"iOS Development for Creative Entrepreneurs\" by UCI.

___
This is a single view project with a *Student* / *Professor* *UISelector* which have 4 fields in them. 
After filling the form and hitting *Add Person* button we add an *NSManagedObject* of that person into the *Container*. Hence saving the data as a persistent storage.

 There is a large Label which views all the stored objects.
And at the bottom there is a *Clear All* button which clears the Persistent Storage Data.
